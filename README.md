## Claimo
Claimo is a full-stack leaderboard system where users can claim random points (1–10) and compete in real-time rankings. Built with Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and ReactJS, the platform allows users to:

Select from a list of 10+ users (with the ability to add more)

Claim random points and see their total update instantly

View a dynamically updated leaderboard based on total points

Maintain a claim history log in the database for every action

This project demonstrates real-time point allocation, dynamic ranking, and data persistence — all with a clean, interactive interface.
